# What it does
This script will activate your webcam, read your facial expression based on a pretrained model (.h5) and make the screen flash if you look angry for too long while working ;)
It gets users to relax their facial expressions since you get quite aware of your expression after the 5th flash. Since the neurological feedback generated by tensing/relaxing facial muscles this does actually change your mood a bit. If you have a very tense facial expression while working try it out.
